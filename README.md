# Insider QA Automation Project

This project is written for the Insider Software QA Assurance role by @miray-gundogdu

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Python

If you haven't already, install Python on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or you can use `brew install python` brew command on your mac.

### Step 2: Install pip

`pip` is a package manager for Python that allows you to easily install and manage Python packages.


### Step 3: Install Selenium

`selenium` is a powerful tool for automating web browsers. In Python, Selenium allows you to control web browsers programmatically, which is particularly useful for testing web applications or scraping web content. To use that, run `pip install selenium` command in your terminal.

#### Windows

If you're on Windows and you installed Python using the official installer, `pip` should be installed by default.

#### macOS and Linux

If you're on macOS or Linux, you may need to install `pip` separately. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip  # For Python 3
```
## Run insider test in your local env
If you're on macOS, you just need to go main folder of the project and run `python main.py` command. The selenium browser should be open and all tests are should be passed.
